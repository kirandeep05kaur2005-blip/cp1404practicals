# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started working on each practical earlier in the week instead of rushing near the deadline. I now 
follow the Git branching workflow more carefully and make smaller, meaningful commits with clear messages.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to manage my time better during coding sessions by setting short focused goals and taking breaks instead of working 
continuously. I also want to review my code more carefully before pushing to GitHub.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am consistently following the coding standards, using functions and classes properly, and committing regularly.
I also read the prac instructions closely and test my programs to ensure correct output.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should stop leaving the reflection and review tasks for the last moment. I also need to rely less on copying patterns
from previous pracs and try to write more original, well-structured solutions from scratch.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would like more guided examples or short video walkthroughs for the more advanced topics such as class design and testing,
so that students can visualise how the code evolves step-by-step.
